# cathacks2018 - Risky Click

This project combs through two social media platforms (Facebook and Twitter) and checks for any inappropriate content that may exist on your profile via text and image using the Facebook and Tweepy API's respectively.  

Text is gathered and checked for inapproprivate content based on tags that can be easily modified (see app/texttags.txt for examples).

Images are interpreted using GoogleCloud API and then filtered through content and likelihood of certain warnings, such as drugs, violence, or how risqu√© the image is.  

This software is useful for employees and employers to quickly and easily comb through a public profile.
